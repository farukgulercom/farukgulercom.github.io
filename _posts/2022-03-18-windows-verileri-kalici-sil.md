<p>Sometimes we may not have enough information on how to permanently delete the data on your Windows Computer and disk. Therefore, as long as you follow the instructions below, you can permanently delete your data and prevent your private files from falling into the hands of malicious people.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Permanently Eliminating Data - Permanently Eliminating Data<br>You should know that those files remain somewhere on the hard disk, even after an ordinary deletion, or even after a permanent deletion. Because the data on your computer that you gave to someone else, sold or changed by saying that you deleted it, can be captured by malicious people with very simple methods.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Just Formatting Is Not Enough!</strong><br>If you want the data on the hard disk to be deleted completely and irreversibly, new data must be written to the area where the data is stored. For this, you should format your hard disk. Even if this process is one step safer, just formatting will not ensure that the data is completely deleted.</p>

<p>When you follow the steps below at the command prompt, the cipher command starts the Cipher feature of Windows. The /w command after that allows random data to be overwritten on the unused data in the free part of the disk. Thanks to these commands, the files you delete will be permanently deleted.</p>

<p>Also, the /w:C command at the end of the command specifies which disk the operation is valid for.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So if you want to clean another disk instead of :C, you will write that drive path. Example: D, F, H etc.</p>
