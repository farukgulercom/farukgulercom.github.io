<p><strong>Delegation is a process of transferring authority,</strong> especially in large and complex Active Directory environments. This process allows people who manage a system to give teams below them the authority to perform certain tasks. This way, administrative tasks can be performed more quickly and efficiently. For example, people working on the user help desk team can gain the authority to manage user accounts. <strong>***</strong> For security reasons, I recommend that you be very careful when granting these permissions.</p>
