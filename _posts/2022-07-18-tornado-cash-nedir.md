<p><strong>The most dangerous project on the market is the Money Mixer TORNADO!</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Decentralized and non-custodial Tornado Cash is an Ethereum-based solution for privacy and anonymity. Disconnecting the on-chain link between coin senders and recipients increases transaction anonymity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This guide will provide our readers with more information about Tornado Cash. We will start with a general introduction and go deeper into how Tornado Cash works. For the reader's benefit, we will also include a list of pros and cons to this system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Understanding Tornado Cash</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Decentralized protocols such as Tornado Cash (TORN) use Ethereum as a platform to facilitate anonymous token transfers. This token mixing platform celebrates its success, the zcash privacy coin system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tornado Cash for transactions, ERC-20 protocol on Ethereum. Once the deposit or withdrawal is complete,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a result, you can ask someone to send money to Tornado Cash and withdraw funds from your wallet. Considering that we are talking about a public blockchain like Ethereum, this mechanism ensures that your financial privacy is protected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>A Look Behind the Scenes</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's say you're a blockchain expert tasked with finding a thief who recently stole your cryptocurrency. After checking Etherscan for the address of the stolen assets, you may discover that the hacker is using Tornado Cash.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Specifically, a hacker can deposit all stolen funds into Tornado Cash. However, there is no way of knowing where your tokens are going after this point.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An inexperienced hacker can redirect the stolen amount to a new wallet immediately after depositing it into Tornado. If this happens, you will be able to locate the suspicious process relatively simply.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, a more experienced hacker might find a way around this problem. For example, hackers can split the stolen amount into dozens of smaller transactions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A hacker can spread withdrawals with random small transactions over a long period of time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tornado Cash's design is quite simple, but it can hide the tracks of its users. Without regulatory investigations, there is no way to link the respective deposits and withdrawals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As an Ethereum blockchain application, Tornado is widely available and simple for both new and experienced users.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Who created Tornado Cash?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Roman Semenov and Roman Storm are the brains behind this coin mixing business. Despite having an official background in Metallurgical Engineering, Storm joined the blockchain industry in 2011.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Various DeFi startups including Blockchainlabs.nz, Amazon, PepperSec, and 0x and Aave are among its previous employers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Their work included evaluating Solidity code, creating smart contracts, and creating ERC-20 tokens for these firms. He also worked on the development of smart contracts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Roman Semenov's academic background focusing on field theory and quantum statistics is also interesting. He was also the co-founder of PepperSec and Viking Studio. He was also among the tasks of optimizing sales funnels and e-commerce conversions at RedHelper.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Tornado Cash blockchain project is based on open source Zcash technology. But Tornado Cash's anonymity mixer service is more popular than Zcash.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>A Proprietary Tokenized System</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like most smart contract technologies, Tornado Cash relies on a native token to manage and provide services. This project depends on the TORN token, which the team claims allows them to relinquish control of the protocol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Within five years, most TORN tokens (55 percent) will enter the market through its community and treasury. Developers and investors hold a 30% stake in TORN's entire supply. The remaining 15% goes to airdrop events (5%) and mining operations (10%).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>TORN tokens have a relatively wide range of applications. For example, owners can take advantage of anonymity mining. Tornado Cash has Anonymity Sets, as you may have observed if you have played with the platform. Users can add coins to these sets and earn rewards, triggering anonymity mining.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tornado Cash Pros</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tornado Cash is a crypto 'mixer', a service that aggregates cryptocurrencies and distributes them to new addresses. ERC-20 compatibility is undoubtedly one of the main advantages of this system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We can identify the system's token on sites like CoinMarketCap, which is often a way of gaining higher market traction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The anonymity mining feature rewards users for supporting the privacy functions of the project by giving them liquidity. This aspect appears to have the potential to provide a long-term improvement in the way Tornado Cash anonymizes transactions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, for investors interested in privacy, Tornado Cash offers a relatively simple set of tools on the market. User friendliness is a key feature in the industry if you want to have a wide market reach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Cons of Tornado Cash</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mixers don't change the game, as they've been around for a while. Remember that even if you use it, it will leave a permanent mark on your address.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have a mixer in your wallet, everyone will know by looking at Etherscan. Ask yourself if this is a risk you're ready to run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tightening crypto legislation may cause authorities to send you an investigation into the matter. Editors may question why you used a mixing service before. Those who choose to engage in illegal activities will have to face the consequences of their actions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The possibility of a hacker to abuse this system is a factor to consider among its disadvantages. If lawmakers decide to tighten their crypto policies, Tornado Cash and similar alternatives will likely be at the center of the regulator's considerations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a final point of contention, experienced Tornado Cash users often complain about the lack of anonymity capabilities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tornado Cash can be a boon for some people who value their privacy. However, the anonymity provided by the service can sometimes be less than ideal for other users.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tornado Cash is a service that helps people protect their privacy and anonymity. In doing so, it wishes to grant independence from the interference of external authorities. Almost all the positive and negative aspects of this decentralized cryptographic system are evident in this last statement.</p>
