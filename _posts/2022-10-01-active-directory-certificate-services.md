<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Online Responder</strong><br>It is used during the process of accepting and canceling the requests of the users regarding the certificates they have requested. At the end of the certificate evaluation process, the Online Responder service evaluates the status and sends back the information containing the status information of the transactions related to the requested certificate by signing.</p>
