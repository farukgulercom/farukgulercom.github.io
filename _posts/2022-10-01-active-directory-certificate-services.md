<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Certification Authority (CA)</strong><br>This service is used for issuing and managing certificates to users, computers and servers. Two options are available as Root or Subordinate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Web Enrollment</strong><br>It allows users to perform certificate creation and certificate revocation requests using the web interface. It is the management screen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Online Responder</strong><br>It is used during the process of accepting and canceling the requests of the users regarding the certificates they have requested. At the end of the certificate evaluation process, the Online Responder service evaluates the status and sends back the information containing the status information of the transactions related to the requested certificate by signing.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Network Device Enrollment Service</strong><br>It is used to obtain certificate information about Routers and devices on the network. It is also a service that enables network devices on the domain to receive certificates.</p>

<p><strong>Certificate Enrollment Policy Web Service</strong><br>This feature is used to obtain information about certificate enrollment policies created by active users and computers on the Web Service. It ensures that certificates are automatically uploaded to user and computer accounts that are not members of the domain, within the framework of determined policies.</p>
