<p><strong>iSCSI: </strong>It is a method of connecting data storage devices (Storage) on it to each other over TCP/IP protocol. For example, available<br>You have a Storage in your structure and this is a system that allows you to use the Disks in Storage as if they were on a local computer by creating Virtual Disks (virtual Disks) on all computers in the Network environment.</p>
