<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>User Account Control (UAC) is a security component in Windows operating systems. "UAC allows users to temporarily escalate their privileges so they can perform tasks that require administrative privileges, such as switching users, logging out, or using the Run As feature."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main purpose of UAC is to increase the security of users and limit unauthorized or potentially harmful actions. UAC obtains your permission by presenting you with a warning or confirmation screen when you want to perform an operation that requires administrative authority. These screens prevent the user from unintentionally or unknowingly initiating a harmful process.</p>
