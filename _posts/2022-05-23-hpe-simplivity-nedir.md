<p><strong>– What is HPE Simplivity?</strong><br>HPE Simplivity is basically a hyper converged infrastructure. In other words, it collects physical servers and storage in a single node or hyperconverged cluster. The old IT infrastructure, that is, storage, network and data protection platforms used today, is not very suitable due to the increasing business face and demands. Because the management of each requires separate experience and knowledge. Of course, the effort spent on their management is very important. Simplivity offers you very fast solutions, but I mean fast solutions, of course, not disk IO performance here. It also offers fast solutions in the disk partition, but you can perform the operations you will do on your infrastructure from a single screen and you can perform the infrastructure operations in a short time. HyperConverged solutions are actively used and are constantly being developed. With the increase in virtualization and increasing business demands, hyperconverged structures have started to meet vital features such as backup, deduplication, WAN optimization and storage cache in IT infrastructure. Thanks to HPE Simplivity, you can take only one click backups of virtual machines in your VMware infrastructure. Again, with one click, you can clone the virtual machine in your VMware infrastructure in seconds, regardless of data size. HPE Simplivity supports both VMware and Hyper-V platform.</p>

<p><strong>– What are the HPE Simplivity Benefits?</strong><br>Research from HPE Simplivity predicts an 81% reduction in the time it takes to manage infrastructure. Accordingly, it foresees a 50% increase in application performance in your infrastructure. When you look at these numbers now, you may not find it convincing. Of course, we cannot keep the same values ​​in every infrastructure, it is a fact here. However, I would like to give some information about the operations. For example, you have a 1TB virtual machine. How long will it take you to make a first backup of it? If you are taking the backup for the first time, you can take the backup in an average of 1 hour depending on your disk performance. If you are making an incremental backup, it will take 5 to 20 minutes, depending on the size of the changed data. The restore period will take quite a long time, just like the first backup. Of course, these are the most optimistic scenarios :) Thanks to Simplivity, you can take a backup of a virtual machine in less than 1 minute and restore it in less than 1 minute.</p>

<p><br><strong>– Benefits for your HPE Simplivity infrastructure:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thanks to Data efficiency:Simplivity, you can manage your data more intelligently thanks to the deduplication and compression operations you will perform in your infrastructure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Deduplication:</strong> With deduplication, you can eliminate unnecessary data. What this means is that by protecting only a unique instance of the data on the disk, the workload, replication bandwidth, and storage capacity available on the disk are reduced. Thus, you can save a significant amount of your infrastructure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Compression:</strong> Compression actually works directly with deduplication. Thanks to compression, Disk workload provides a complementary value to deduplication by further reducing disk replicaiton bandwidth and storage capacity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Optimization:</strong> It is the process of processing the data on the disk depending on the usage foreseen by an application thanks to optimization. It can identify file types and make real-time decisions about where to store that data. Thus, a continuous optimization can be achieved.</p>

<p>HPE Simplivity HyperConverged Node: An x86 server that is the core hardware building block of the HPE SimpliVity hyperconverged infrastructure solution. Here we come across 2 models. These; HPE Simplivity 380 and HPE Simplivity 2600. I have given information about the HPE Simplivity architecture before, but I would like to give a brief detail. HPE offers you Simplivity nodes in 2 different models. These;</p>

<p>Simplivity 380: A node built on top of HPE's best-selling model. The HPE DL380 series is actively used in many datacenters today. He combined HPE's experience on the server with Simplivity here.<br>Simplivity 2600: HPE Simplivity 170 Gen10 and HPE Simplivity 190 Gen10 servers are more optimized for ROBO environments.<br>HPE OmniStack Virtual Controller (OVC): It is the software that is implemented as a single virtual machine per node and controls all aspects of the HPE Simplivitiy hyperconverged infrastructure. This virtual machine is very critical. The reason for this is that the Omnistack Accelerator Card is an important component that is directly connected and also provides the management of datastores.</p>
