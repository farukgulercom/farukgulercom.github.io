<p>Windows Admin Center is a Microsoft product that allows managing Windows servers and other devices running the Windows operating system through a central interface. Windows Admin Center brings together network management, server management, storage management, security monitoring, event log monitoring, virtual machine management and many more administrative tasks in a single console.</p>

<p>Windows Admin Center is especially useful for remote server management. This allows you to easily monitor and manage remote servers with a central interface, so you don't have to physically be at the server's location. Additionally, thanks to the extensibility of Windows Admin Center with a number of extensions and plug-ins, it supports a variety of server roles and functions.</p>
