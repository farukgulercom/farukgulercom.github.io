<p>Active Directory is designed for Microsoft Windows domain networks and is a special purpose database. It comes as a set of processes and services attached with most Windows server operating systems. A server that runs the Active Directory Domain Services is the domain controller that validates and gives a go ahead to all users and machines in Windows domain network.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This helps appoint and apply security codes for all machines and for installation or software update. So, if a user tries to log in to your Windows domain computer, Active Directory authenticates the password entered, identifies and differentiates between a system administrator and a regular user.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Active Directory is specially developed to read a large number of modifications and updates made to your computer.
