<p>Websites are no longer one-page business cards with simple HTML and design like they were in the early 90s. Today's websites are often complex ecosystems of pages, images, links, system integrations, self-service, shopping, and other functions. For all these elements to come together, they need to be organized by a content management system.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>So what is CMS?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is Content Management System (CMS)?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Content management system (CMS) – a content management system is a computer software system that manages and regulates the creation, modification, and publication of digital content such as documents and images, often in a collaborative environment, for presentation on a website. It is easy to use and requires little or no experience to operate. Instead of having to rely on multiple systems to create, publish and archive various elements of your website (e.g. web design, image storage, content creation and functionality), you can control most of its functionality with the CMS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A CMS is a great solution for those struggling with the above challenges and needing a new way to organize their daily content creation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CMS performs many tasks, both visible and invisible. Some of the most common features that a content management system provides are as follows:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>-Editing text<br>-metadata<br>-Design<br>-General site hierarchy<br>-URL logic<br>-Media<br>-Release dates<br>-User roles<br>-Organization of different posts and pages within the hierarchy<br>-History editing and version control<br>-Indexing<br>-Call</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of these features can be changed or removed by any user, even with limited technical knowledge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All these features are performed by the CMS, which is a great advantage and time saver for the editorial and marketing teams. Some other advantages of CMS include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It reduces the need for coding from scratch.<br>Creating a unified look and feel is easy.<br>Disadvantages may include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Layouts, web apps, etc. Limited or non-existent ability to create functionality not envisioned in the original CMS.<br>Content writers need special expertise and training.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How CMS Works ?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A CMS has two core elements: a content management application (CMA) and a content delivery application (CDA).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Content Management Application (CMA): CMA is the front end of the CMS where users create, manage and edit their content. Some CMS programs may have prebuilt templates that store common edits and create frequently repeated operations. This makes it easier for the user to refer to their parts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Content Delivery Application (CDA): CDA, also called content delivery network (CDN), is the behind the scenes of CMA and helps to store, publish and improve website responsiveness and load times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The combination of the two sub-interfaces ensures that creators don't need to know HTML or JavaScript coding, but having experience with coding can be helpful. If you know what it's like to build a website from scratch, it can help you focus on desired website design skills in the overall website creation and publishing process. Of course, these skills are not necessary. Users with little or no coding experience can achieve the same result.</p>

<p><strong>What are the Key Features of CMS?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>A CMS has many features that are more fundamental than others. That's why you need to consider the following points when searching for the CMS that best fits your needs:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Multi-language option: </strong>Not everyone speaks the language in which the original content was published. The ability to translate content into various languages ​​and make it available to a wider audience is a must when looking for a CMS platform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Customer support: </strong>Do research on multiple CMS companies, take the time to read customer reviews and see how companies are handling these issues. If the company has a bad reputation for customer support, you should not choose this CMS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Compatibility with mobile devices: </strong>According to Statista, 50.81% of global website traffic is generated through a mobile device. That's why it's important to find a CMS that is mobile-friendly and adapts your website to fit any device.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>User-friendly</strong>: It is very difficult to find a CMS that meets most of the expectations of your current and future audience. This means it should have fast page load times and offer design options that allow you to make your site more visually appealing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Access to Search Engine Optimization (SEO) tools: </strong>Access to the right SEO tools is important in a CMS platform, not just for your website in general. That's why you need to choose a CMS that allows you to customize your website to appear SEO friendly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>meta-descriptions;<br>Page titles;<br>“rel=" tags (rel="next", rel="prev");<br>Title tags;<br>URL<br><strong>Security:</strong> Of course, you need to make sure you invest in a safe and secure CMS so that there is little risk of your valuable company information being hacked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Why Do You Need CMS?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
