<p><strong>1)</strong> <strong>ADB</strong>; is a versatile command line tool that lets you communicate with an Android device. It has functions such as ADB commands, application installation, debugging, taking screenshots from the device. You can also transfer files bidirectionally via ADB.<br>It can also perform many other actions, such as installing a custom ROM (replacing the manufacturer's Android).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Client: </strong>The client runs on your development machine. You can invoke the client from terminal with ADB commands.<br><strong>ADBD (Service):</strong> A daemon that runs commands on the device.<br><strong>Client (Server): </strong>Manages the communication between the client and the background program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2)</strong> <strong>Fastboot</strong>; is a menu used on Android devices. Through this menu, you can reinstall the Android operating system on your Android device and perform the boot operations. It is a menu that is generally used to install Rom on the phone. In addition to the official version via Fastboot, you can use the Beta versions opened for developers by installing them on your device.</p>

<p><strong>How ADB Works?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":4106,"width":600,"height":313,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://theguler.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/adb-android.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-4106" width="600" height="313" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>When you start ADB, the client first checks to see if there is a running ADB server process. If not, the server starts the process. When the server first starts, it connects to 'local' TCP port 5037 and listens for requests from the client. All clients use port 5037 to communicate with the server.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then the server connects with all running devices and the first 16 devices establish ports with odd numbers in the range of 5555 to 5585. Note that every emulator links with an even number.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example;<br>Emulator 1, console : 5554<br>Emulator 1, adb : 5555<br>Emulator 2, console : 5556<br>Emulator 2, adb : 5557<br>…………...<br>……….</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the server has successfully connected to all devices, you can access them using adb commands. You can control it from any client or script.</p>

<p><strong>A) How to Install ADB ?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How to turn on USB Debugging?</strong><br><strong>Step #1: </strong>Enter Settings,<br><strong>Step #2: </strong>Enter the system partition,<br><strong>Step #3:</strong> Go to About phone section,<br><strong>Step #4:</strong> Tap the Build number line 4 times in a row,<br>"You are now a developer" will appear on the screen.<br><strong>Step #5:</strong> Go back to Settings,<br><strong>Step #6:</strong> Tap on the Developer Options line,<br><strong>Step #7:</strong> You can turn “USB Debugging” on or off on the bottom line,<br>If you're not a developer, we recommend keeping it turned off.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>B)</strong> <strong>ADB setup and setup for Windows</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>#Adb driver download links are at the end of the article</strong>.<br>-Download the ADB ZIP file for Windows<br>-Extract the contents of this ZIP file to a folder<br>-Enter the extracted file<br>-Then, hold down Shift and right-click here and click "open command system here"<br>-Connect your phone or tablet to your computer with a USB cable<br>-Change your USB mode to file transfer mode (Some phones may want it, some don't)<br>-To see the devices that start ADB in the background, type the "adb devices" command in the command prompt we opened<br>-A warning will appear on the screen of your phone as allow or not to allow USB Debugging mode.<br>-Finally, enter the "adb devices" command again and you will see the device name or ip address</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>C)</strong> <strong>Installation (for Linux devices)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>-Extract the zip content on your desktop. Open a command prompt or terminal.<br>-Now go to the folder where you extracted the ADB content and enter the following command:<br>cd /path/to/extracted/folder/<br>-Now you need to connect your phone to your Linux PC.<br>-Finally, enter the following command to check the connection between your Phone and Mac PC<br>"adb devices"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>D)</strong> <strong>ADB setup and setup for macOS</strong><br>-Download the ADB ZIP file for macOS<br>-Extract the contents of this ZIP file to a folder<br>-Open the terminal,<br>-Go to the location where you extracted the ADB example; cd/Users/Theguler/Desktop/adb-tools<br>-Connect your phone or tablet to your computer with a USB cable<br>-Enable file transfer mode (MTP)<br>-A warning will appear on your phone's screen as allow or disallow USB Debugging mode.<br>-Finally, enter the "adb devices" command again and you will see the device name or ip address</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>E) Connecting to a device via Wi-Fi using ADB:</strong><br>ADB usually communicates with the device via USB, but you can also use adb over Wi-Fi after the initial setup via USB as below.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Setup to use with ADB Wi-Fi:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>-Connect your Android device and your device using ADB to the same wireless network.<br>-Connect the device to the device you are using ADB with a USB cable<br>-Set the target device to listen for a TCP/IP connection on port 5555 by saying adb tcpip 5555</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>-Disconnect the USB cable from the target device<br>-See the IP address of your device by saying Settings&gt;Wifi Settings&gt;Advanced Connect to the device with IP address "adb connect device_ip_address"<br>-You can use the adb devices command to see if it is connected.</p>

<strong>Command Not Found:</strong> You made a mistake or the command is not yet available in your version of ADB. Check the command with the help of adb or update to a newer ADB version.

<strong>No Device:</strong> Your USB cable is not connected properly, the ADB interface on your phone is not working or your computer does not recognize your smartphone. Try using a different USB port, another cable, enable USB debugging, check drivers, computer and reboot your device.

<strong>Server is out of date:</strong> ADB Tools on your computer and Android version on your smartphone must be compatible. If they don't, this error occurs. Update your ADB Tools version.

<strong>Waiting for device: </strong>This error is largely the same as the No Device error. Your computer does not recognize your smartphone.</pre>

<p>USB Debugging, which enables the connection of Android devices with computers and is the companion of developers, is an option that is recommended to be turned off if not needed. Enabling USB Debugging leaves your Android device vulnerable to many dangers. Even charging your device in a public area with this feature turned on is a problem for your device. When a malicious user takes over your device, if the USB Debugging feature is active, they can access the device without the need for any PIN.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you do not constantly connect your Android device to your computer or do not have a routine operation with USB Debugging, we recommend leaving this setting off. Thus, you will take the right move to protect your device.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What can be done with USB Debugging?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With USB Debugging, you can speed up the application development process, use advanced commands and Root your device by connecting your Android device to a computer. In addition to all this, you can also use USB Debugging to send ADB (Android Debug Bridge) commands to your Android device. In this way, you can install an APK file on the computer to the device and even perform a recovery of a device that does not work.</p>
