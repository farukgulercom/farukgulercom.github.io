<p><strong>In short, with the NIC Teaming feature, it means that the line continues to work actively in the Failover structure in case one of the ethernet cards is disabled by grouping the ethernet cards installed on the server.</strong></p>

<p>Network connection stability is one of the most important points after data redundancy for a server running in a live environment. No matter how strong and secure you have a server and software running on it, when your network connection is lost, life will stop and services will become dysfunctional. Today, almost all servers are produced and sold with more than one network card on it. Even if you have an old server with a single ethernet card, you can get a second ethernet card at a low cost and back up your server's network connection. At this point, the advantage of Windows Server is that we can team up with the software provided by the card manufacturers and the hardware belonging to the same manufacturer and sometimes the same serial products, but now we can team any two A and B brand ethernet cards independent of the manufacturer.</p>
