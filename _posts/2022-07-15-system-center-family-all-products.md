In particular, it helps to reduce costs and supports all kinds of platforms.<br>In addition, it can perform both server and client consolidation (compilation, assembly in a central area).<br>It reduces hardware costs by running multiple server roles on a single physical machine. Of course, cost savings appear as a plus in such a case, not only in hardware but also in licensing.<br>Apart from such benefits, the desired tests on all kinds of platforms can be tried on virtual machines before trying them on real structures.</p>
